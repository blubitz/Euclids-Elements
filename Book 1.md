1. A `point` is that which has no part.
   
   A `quantity` is something that can be divided into parts. A `point` isn't a quantity because it cannot be further divided. It is the last concept a mind can conceive after which nothing is left. A point is more material than a number as it has position whereas numbers are conceived without form or figure.

2. A `line` is a length without breadth.
  
   The `quantities` in increasing number of dimensions are:
   1. Line
   2. Superficies (aka Surface)
   3. Body (aka Solids)
  
   A `line` is also defined as the motion of a point, because the motion draws a line.

   A `line` is also defined as a magnitude of 1 dimension.
   
3. The ends of lines are points.
   
   `points` represent the ends of a `quantity`, such as the ends of a line. `points` are not `quantities` nor parts of `quantities`.

   `units` are the beggining of numbers, without magnitude. In the same way, `points` are the beginning of lines, without `quantity`. However, `units` are still a part of numbers, as numbers are a collection of units and can be divided into them. But `lines` are not composed of `points` nor can be divided into `points`. Lines cannot be composed of points because adding things without quantity will never produce quantity.

4. A `right line` is that which lies equally between its points. (straight line)

   A `right line` does not go up or down between its start and end points.

   It is also defined by Arhimedes as the shorest extension drawn betwen two points.

   It is also defined by Campanus of Novara as the shortes of all lines that have the same end points.

    It is also defined by Plato as a line whereby blocking the middle does not prevent one end from seeing the other. (which I think is rather a circular way of saying light travels in straight lines, (unless under the influence of gravity, which will have to wait until Special Relativity))

   One curved line between two points can be more curved than the other, but there can only be one straight line.

5. A `superficies` is that which has only length and breadth.

   A surface has quantities in two dimensions.

   Another definition of `superfices` are the ends of a body, just like `points` are to `lines`

6. Extremes of surfaces are lines.

7. A plain surface is that which lies equally between its lines.
