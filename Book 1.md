# Definitions



1. A `point` is that which has no part.
   
   A `quantity` is something that can be divided into parts. A `point` isn't a quantity because it cannot be further divided. It is the last concept a mind can conceive after which nothing is left. A point is more material than a number as it has position whereas numbers are conceived without form or figure.

2. A `line` is a length without breadth.
  
   The `quantities` in increasing number of dimensions are:
   1. Line
   2. Superficies (aka Surface)
   3. Body (aka Solids)
  
   A `line` is also defined as the motion of a point, because the motion draws a line.

   A `line` is also defined as a magnitude of 1 dimension.
   
3. The ends of lines are points.
   
   `points` represent the ends of a `quantity`, such as the ends of a line. `points` are not `quantities` nor parts of `quantities`.

   `units` are the beggining of numbers, without magnitude. In the same way, `points` are the beginning of lines, without `quantity`. However, `units` are still a part of numbers, as numbers are a collection of units and can be divided into them. But `lines` are not composed of `points` nor can be divided into `points`. Lines cannot be composed of points because adding things without quantity will never produce quantity.

4. A `right line` is that which lies equally between its points. (straight line)

   A `right line` does not go up or down between its start and end points.

   It is also defined by Arhimedes as the shortest extension drawn betwen two points.

   It is also defined by Campanus of Novara as the shortest of all lines that have the same end points.

    It is also defined by Plato as a line whereby blocking the middle does not prevent one end from seeing the other. (which I think is rather a circular way of saying light travels in straight lines, (unless under the influence of gravity, which will have to wait until Special Relativity))

   One curved line between two points can be more curved than the other, but there can only be one straight line.

5. A `superficies` is that which has only length and breadth.

   A surface has quantities in two dimensions.

   Another definition of `superfices` are the ends of a body, just like `points` are to `lines`

6. Extremes of surfaces are lines.

7. A plain (flat) surface is that which lies equally between its lines.

   A `plain surface` lies equally smooth between its lines without swelling or depression.

   It is also defined as the shortest extension drawn from one line to another.

8. A plain angle is an inclination of two lines that touch each other, but the two lines must not be able to form a single straight line after joining, or else there will be no angle.

9. If the lines which contain the angle are right (straight) lines, then the angle is called a `rightlined angle`.

10. If a right (straight) line standing on another right (straight) line marks two equal angles on both sides, then either of those angles are `right angles`, and the right (straight) line that stands errected is called a perpendicular line to the other line.

11. An `obtuse angle` is an angle greater than a right angle.

12. An `acute angle` is an angle less than a right angle.

13. A limit or term is the end of every thing.

    All `quantities` are defined to be finite and the ends of quantities are limits which enclose them.

14. A `figure` is something that is contained by terms or limits.

    A circle is contained by 1 term, and triangles 3 terms, sqaures 4 terms.

16. A `circle` is a plain figure, contained by one line, which is called the circumference, onto which all lines drawn from one point in the figure have equal length.

17. The center of the circle is the point mentioned above.

18. The `diameter of a circle` is a right (straight) line passing through the center, which ends at the circumference on either side, and divides the circle in two equal parts.

    It was proven by Thales Miletus that if a line passing through the center did not divide the circle into two equal parts, then all lines drawn from the center to the circumference are not equal.

19. A `semicircle` is a `figure` enclosed by the diameter and the circumference cut by the diameter.

20. A `section` or portion of a circle is a `figure` contained under a right (straight) line, and a part of the circumference, and is either greater than or less than the semi-circle.

21. A righlined figure is a `figure` that is contained under right (straight) lines.

21, 22, 23. 3-sided, 4-sided, and many-sided figures are figures contained by their respective number of right (straight) lines.

   No figures can be formed under three straight lines.

24. A triangle with equal sides is an `equilateral triangle`.

25. A triangle with only 2 equal sides is an `isosceles triangle`.

26. A `scalene triangle` is a triangle with no equal sides.

27. A `rightangled triangle` is a traingle which has a right angle.

28. An `obtuse angle triangle` is a triangle with an obtuse angle.
   
29. An `actueangled triangle` is a triangle with has three acute angles.

30. A `square` is a four sided figure with equal sides and right angles.

31. A `figure` which has right angles but unequal sides is called a long square (rectangle).

32. A `rhombus` has 4 equal sides but not rightangled.

33. A (diamond like) (parallelogram) is a `figure` whose opposite sides and oppsoite angles are equal, but not all sides are equal and there are no right angles.

34. All other 4-sided figures that are not squares, rectangles, rhombuses and parallelograms are `trapezoids`.

35. `Parallel lines` are right (straight) lines on the same surface, and extending infinitely, never instersect with each other.

# Petitions?

1. A straight line can be drawn between any two points.

2. To extend a right (straight) line, continue after passing the end point.

3. A circle can be described by a center and a distance.

4. All right angles are equal to one another.

5. When a straight line intersects two straight lines, it creates two pairs of interior angles on either side of the transversal. If the sum of the interior angles on one side of the transversal is less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if extended indefinitely, will meet (concur) on that side.

6. Two straight lines cannot include a surface.

   A surface requires 3 straight lines minimum.

# Common Sentences

Common sentences are more general propositions that extend beyond geometry and manifest in easier to understand forms than petitions.

1. Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.

2. Adding equal things onto equal things will produce an equal whole.

3. Taking away equal things from equal things will still produce equal things.
